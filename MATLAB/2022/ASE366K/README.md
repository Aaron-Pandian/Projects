# Spacecraft Dynamics

## Overview
This class covered the fundamentals of spacecraft motion.  This includes solutions to the two-body problem and works up to interplanetary trajectory design using simple patched conic solutions.

## Projects
Even though this course was primarily textbook, applications of our knowledge were graded though software. An assignment worth noting was the creation of a MATLAB script that used various information to derrive orbital elements.
