# Spacecraft Dynamics

## Overview
This class covered the fundamental concepts, fluid statics, integral and differential analysis, detailed analysis of inviscid, incompressible flows, aerodynamics of airfoils and wings.

## Projects
Even though this course was primarily textbook, applications of our knowledge were graded though software. An assignment worth noting was the modeling of a source-sink pair in a uniform stream of fluid.
