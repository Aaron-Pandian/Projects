# Engineering Computation

## Overview
Aim to learn fundamental numerical methods and software tools used in engineering computation. Subjects include linear systems of equations, matrix computations, nonlinear equations, least squares approximations, interpolation, numerical integration and numerical solution of differential equations. 

## Projects 
Disregarding the poor naming of files, assignments from the course are shown above. Furthermore, major projects in the course are detailed in [COE 311K Final Project](https://github.com/Aaron-Pandian/Projects/tree/main/MATLAB/2021/COE%20311K%20Final%20Project) and [COE 311K Project 1](https://github.com/Aaron-Pandian/Projects/tree/main/MATLAB/2021/COE%20311K%20Project%201) where I conduct work with Euler methods and drug sequencing for tumors, respectively.
