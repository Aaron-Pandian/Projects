# Feedback Control Systems

## Overview
This course tought the fundamentals of linear control analysis and design for single-input, single-output systems; stability and performance measures; Routh Hurwitz analysis; root locus methods; frequency response (Bode and Nyquist); introduction to full-state feedback.

## Projects
This course was primarily theoretical, we had few opporitunties to apply theory outside of hand-worked mathematics. However, this course provided an introduction to PID systems and Simulink that spurred future work.
