# Bridging Barriers: Good Systems

## Overview
An overview of the organization can be found on thier [website](https://bridgingbarriers.utexas.edu/good-systems). My expereience was in working with the [Smart Tools project](https://bridgingbarriers.utexas.edu/good-systems/projects/making-smart-tools-work-for-everyone) as a software engineer supporting PhD students. 

## Contributions
In my role, I was able to introduce and effectively navigate through C++ within the Arduino IDE as a first timer. Additionally, my scope bounded machine learning to pose estimation protocols. A few contributions to the team I was able to soley develop are shown above.
