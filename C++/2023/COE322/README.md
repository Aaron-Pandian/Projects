# Scientific Computation

## Overview
This course explored the basic tools needed for developing scientific computing software. These include advanced programming languages (e.g. C, C++, Python, Fortan), object oriented programming and data structures. Subjects included abstract data types; creation, initialization, and destruction of objects; class hierarchies; polymorphism, inheritance and dynamic binding; generic programming using templates, linked lists, queues, stacks, trees and algorithms such as searching, sorting, and hashing.

## Projects
Above are somewhat notable projects showcasing applied computing concepts from the course, unfortunately, some scripts showcasing concepts above were not recovered.
