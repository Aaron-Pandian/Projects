# Controls, Autonomy, Estimation, and Learning for Uncertain Systems (CAELUS)

## Overview
The CAELUS Laboratory  focuses on research at the intersection of uncertainty quantification and data/information fusion to solve modern and future problems in dynamics and control.

## Personal Contribution
My work in this lab spanned few areas regarding Physics and Software Engineering.

* Created a script taking advantage of NVIDIA Numba to generate 10,000 high-resolution (10,000 Ã— 10,000 pi) GMM matrices for DQN training within 8 seconds using jobless GPUs from our remote server. 
* Worked with creating a DQN model, training it and testing it to achieve target aquisition. The model could not be shown here, but prior work in a similar framework was conducted on the Beat Atari arcade game.
* Aided in constructing an Earth orbit propagator on Python using Draper Semi-analytical Satellite Theory, this also could not be featured here.
